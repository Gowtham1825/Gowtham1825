# 🌍 Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting air quality levels using advanced machine learning techniques to support environmental insights and decision-making. The models are trained on real-world air quality data and aim to provide accurate forecasts for pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and O3.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict air quality levels (e.g., AQI or specific pollutants) using historical environmental data.
- **Techniques:** Supervised machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning (MLP, LSTM).
- **Outcome:** A trained model capable of forecasting pollution levels, aiding environmental monitoring and public health initiatives.
